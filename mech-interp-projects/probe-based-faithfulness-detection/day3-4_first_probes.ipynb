    "### Analysis Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Look at your plots and answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Does accuracy improve in later layers?** Why or why not?\n",
    "   - Your answer: Accuracy of the sentiment analysis probe increased from 85.71% (on all layers prior to layer 10) to 92.86% for the later layers. This is because the transformer model progressively builds abstract representations, i.e. early layers in the model are encoding syntax and local patterns while later layers in the model are encoding semantic concepts like sentiment. (Additional Note to Research: Logit lens literature is supposed to show that later layers contain more task-relevant information)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which layer has the best test accuracy?** Is this surprising?\n",
    "   - Your answer: Layers 10 and 11 had the best test accuracy at 92.86%. This suggests that sentiment is a high-level semantic feature as the representations added to the residual stream by later layers are helpful for improving sentiment detection, i.e. the residual stream at later layers has accumulated enough semantic processing that sentiment is linearly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are any layers severely overfitting (gap >15%)?** What could cause this?\n",
    "   - Your answer: No layers are severely overfitting, although layers prior to layer 10 are close to overfitting with a train/test gap close to 15%. Layers could potentially overfit if their representations are not well-suited for the task. In this case the probe would then look for brittle, dataset-specific features rather than robust ones. If there is high overfitting at a layer then it would suggest that information may not be cleanly linearly separable there. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connection to CoT faithfulness:** If you were probing for \"faithful reasoning,\" would you focus on early, middle, or late layers? Why?\n",
    "   - Your answer: I'm not sure. Faithful reasoning means that the model's stated reasoning actually caused the conclusion. Early layers in the model build syntatic representations of the dataset, while later layers in the model are mostly used for output generation. Therefore, I think that it's possible that the middle layers may be more responsible for the model adding its internal representation of it's reasoning process (i.e. does the model internally represent the causal relationship between it's stated reasoning and the conclusion?) to the residual stream before these are then overwritten by output formatting in later layers. I'd have to test this out though.\n",
    "   **Prediction to Test:** If faithfulness information is in the middle layers, then I would expect that probes between layers 4-7 would be better able to detect unfaithful chain-of-thought (CoT) than layers 10-11. If the later layers are better, then this would suggest that the model \"knows\" about faithfulness even at the output time. \n",
    "\n",
    "   ** Additional Summary Note:** Later layers in the model encode semantic features, while middle layers in the model might encode more of the compuational state.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer these carefully (they're crucial for understanding probes):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why might probe get 90% on test set but 60% on different distribution?**\n",
    "   - Your answer: During training the probe may have learned syntactic features from the original dataset which are not consistent in the new dataset. This would would result in a performance drop when the probe is used on the new dataset. Moreover, the distribution shift also helps to expose what the probe actually learned. If the probe has 90% accuracy in the test dataset of the orginal distribution it means that the probed actually learned something that correlated with sentiment in that distribution. If the probe drops its performance, i.e. to to 60% accuracy, on a different distribution then it would indicate that the probe was exploiting some type of distributional artifact in the original dataset, and not actually probing the underlying concept itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What spurious correlations might the probe have learned?** (Examples: sentence length, specific words, punctuation)\n",
    "   - Your answer: The probe could have learned spurious correlations like longer sentences occurring more frequently for positive/negative sentiment, specific words which frequently occur in positive/negative sentiment sentences and lastly different punctuation styles that may occur more frequently for sentences with different sentiments, i.e. exclamation marks could occur more frequently for (short) positive sentiment sentences like \"This was the best book!\". Additional feedback examples from Claude to consider: \n",
    "   1. Lexical shortcuts: Specific sentiment words (\"love\", \"hate\") that might not generalize to implicit sentiment (\"This exceeded expectations\")\n",
    "   2. Structural shortcuts: Sentence patterns, punctuation, length\n",
    "   3. Position shortcuts: Where sentiment words appear in the sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "   Similar examples of spurious correlations for faithfulness: \n",
    "   1. Reasoning length\n",
    "   2. Presence of math symbols\n",
    "   3. Words like \"because\"/\"therefore\"\n",
    "   4. Confidence phrases\n",
    "\n",
    "   Need to think about what artifacts might exist for faithfulness datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How would you test if probe detects sentiment vs. sentence length?**\n",
    "   - Your answer: To test if the probe detects sentiment vs. sentence length I'd create a dataset of positive/negative sentences where the length of the sentences are varied in length (increasing from short to long sentences). I'd then stratify the train/test dataset to include a balanced number of the positive and negative sentences for each different sentence length and then determine whether examples where the probe misclassified the sentences corresponded to a specific sentence length. I could also create additional separate test datasets whose sentence length varies and run the classifier on each test dataset and see if the accuracy is low for any particular sentence length.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Feedback from Claude: \n",
    "      Do direct causal intervention. Create sentence pairs that are matched on sentiment but differ on length:\n",
    "   - \"Great!\" (positive, short)\n",
    "   - \"This is a truly great and wonderful experience!\" (positive, long)\n",
    "   - \"Terrible.\" (negative, short)\n",
    "   - \"This is an absolutely terrible and awful experience.\" (negative, long)\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the probe uses length, it will assign different predictions to same-sentiment sentences of different lengths. This directly tests the causal role of length.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Even better: Look at the probe's learned weights. Which dimensions have highest weight? Correlate those with length-related features in the embedding space. This is mechanistic rather than\n",
    "   behavioral.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How would you design a causal intervention to test whether your faithfulness probe uses actual faithfulness vs. reasoning style?**\n",
    "   - Your answer: To design this causal intervention I'd need to do similar to the sentiment vs sentence length causal intervention experiment and create a dataset with matched examples of faithful and unfaithful CoT for different reasoning styles and then train the probe on this. I'd expect the probe to perform well at faithfulness detection across the different reasoning styles. If the probe uses reasoning style for its predictions then it would assign different predictions to faithful CoT examples with different reasoning styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Claude Feedback: \n",
    "\n",
    "   What does \"different reasoning styles\" mean concretely?\n",
    "\n",
    "   You need to operationalize this. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Style variations to control for:\n",
    "   - Verbose vs. terse (\"Let me think step by step... First, I calculate X. Then, I consider Y. Therefore Z.\" vs. \"X implies Y, so Z.\")\n",
    "   - Formal vs. casual (\"One must consider that...\" vs. \"So basically...\")\n",
    "   - With/without hedging (\"I believe the answer is...\" vs. \"The answer is...\")\n",
    "   - Numbered steps vs. prose\n",
    "   - Presence/absence of \"therefore\", \"because\", \"thus\"\n",
    "\n",
    "   Your intervention design should be a 2x2:\n",
    "\n",
    "   |         | Faithful           | Unfaithful           |\n",

    "   | Style A | Faithful + Style A | Unfaithful + Style A |\n",
    "   | Style B | Faithful + Style B | Unfaithful + Style B |\n",
    "\n",
    "   If the probe uses faithfulness: accuracy is high across both styles.\n",
    "   If the probe uses style: accuracy differs between styles, or the probe systematically misclassifies one style.\n",
    "\n",
    "   You're missing the harder problem\n",
    "\n",
    "   Creating matched faithful/unfaithful pairs is non-trivial. How do you know if reasoning is faithful?\n",
    "\n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   1. Synthetic construction: You write the CoT yourself, controlling whether it's causally connected to the answer\n",
    "   2. Model-generated with intervention: Generate CoT, then corrupt it (change the conclusion but keep reasoning, or vice versa)\n",
    "   3. Use tasks with verifiable reasoning: Math problems where you can check if the steps actually lead to the answer\n",
